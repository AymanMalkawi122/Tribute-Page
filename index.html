            <h2>Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life</h2>
            <ul id="time-line">
                <li><strong>1912</strong> - Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in Maida Vale, London.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1926</strong> - At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence and
                    potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.</li>
                <li><strong>1931</strong> - Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge.
                    He
                    was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.</li>
                <li><strong>1936</strong> - Turing studied mathematics and cryptology while also building three of
                    four
                    stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.</li>
                <li><strong>1940</strong> - Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic
                    machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>1947</strong> - Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE
                    (Automatic Computing Engine).</li>
                <li><strong>1948</strong> - Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still
                    used
                    today to solve matrix equations.</li>
                <li><strong>1948</strong> - Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the
                    University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program
                    computers.</li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> - The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to
                    compare
                    the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.</li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> - dies at the age of 41</li>
            </ul>
